My name is Alex Melia.

I am a recent Software Engineering BSc graduate from the Manchester Metropolitan University.
I graduated with First Class Honours 1:1.

Currently, I am focused on making SaaS projects!

Previously I have made projects such as KickTalk - a Twitter Clone for Football fans, BlogAbout - a serverless Blogging Application and Dexx - an AI Flashcard & Roadmap generator.

INTERESTS: Listening to Programming, Music, Playing Guitar, Liverpool FC, MMA.

I have an ecclectic taste when it comes to music. I could be listening to some smooth Jazz one 
day, and then some heavy Rock music the next. I would say my favourite genre right now would have 
to be Deep old school House. No big drops, just smooth constant rhythm!

My favourite album of all time is Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park! Honorable mention to AM by Arctic 
Monkeys.
